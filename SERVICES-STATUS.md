## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### Problem 1: Port Conflict
**Issue:** Realtime-worker was failing with "address already in use" error  
**Cause:** Code was trying to start two servers on port 8004
- Prometheus metrics server: `start_http_server(8004)`
- FastAPI uvicorn server: `uvicorn.run(app, port=8004)`

**Solution:** Removed duplicate Prometheus server since FastAPI Instrumentator already handles metrics

### Problem 2: Startup Order
**Issue:** Frontend services couldn't connect to API Gateway  
**Cause:** Services were starting in wrong order

**Solution:** Started services in correct dependency order:
1. Database & Redis (infrastructure)
2. Backend services (task-service, api-gateway, etc.)
3. Frontend services (admin, pwa, tv)

### Problem 3: Missing Network
**Issue:** Services couldn't start due to missing "monitoring" network  
**Solution:** Created the monitoring network: `docker network create monitoring`

lsof -i :[port-number]

# Change port in docker-compose.yml
# Or stop the conflicting service
```

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check database is running
docker-compose ps db

# Check database logs
docker-compose logs db

# Reset database
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d db
```

### Can't Access Frontend
```bash
# Check if service is running
docker-compose ps

# Check nginx logs
docker-compose logs admin
docker-compose logs pwa
docker-compose logs tv
