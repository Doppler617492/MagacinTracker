## 🔧 **How MC3300 Hardware Scanner Works**

### **Zebra DataWedge Integration:**

The MC3300 has **DataWedge** - Zebra's scanner-to-keyboard software:

```
1. Worker presses physical SCAN trigger
   ↓
2. MC3300 scans barcode: "501234567890"
   ↓
3. DataWedge injects as keyboard input
   ↓
4. Your input field receives: "501234567890"
   ↓
5. Auto-Enter (DataWedge setting)
   ↓
6. Your smart detection: "This is a scan!" ✓
   ↓
7. Process barcode
```

### **DataWedge Default Settings:**
```
✓ Output: Keyboard emulation
✓ Auto-Enter: Enabled (sends Enter after scan)
✓ Focus: Active input field
✓ Timing: <50ms (your 150ms detection works!)
```
