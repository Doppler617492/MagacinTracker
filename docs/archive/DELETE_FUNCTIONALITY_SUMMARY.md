# Delete Functionality for Trebovanja - Implementation Summary

## âœ… **What Was Implemented**

### Backend Changes

1. **TrebovanjeRepository.delete()** - Added delete method with:
   - Validation that trebovanje exists
   - Check that trebovanje is not in progress or completed
   - Audit logging before deletion
   - Cascade deletion of related records

2. **DELETE /api/trebovanja/{trebovanje_id}** - New API endpoint with:
   - Role-based access control (ADMIN and SEF only)
   - Proper error handling
   - Success response with message

3. **AuditAction.trebovanje_deleted** - New audit action for tracking deletions

### Frontend Changes

1. **Delete Button** - Added to the "Akcije" column in trebovanja table:
   - Red "ObriÅ¡i" button with danger styling
   - Disabled for in_progress and done statuses
   - Loading state during deletion

2. **Confirmation Dialog** - Popconfirm component with:
   - Clear warning message
   - Document number in confirmation text
   - "ObriÅ¡i" and "OtkaÅ¾i" buttons
   - Danger styling for delete button

3. **Delete Mutation** - React Query mutation with:
   - API call to DELETE endpoint
   - Success message: "Trebovanje obrisano"
   - Error handling with detailed messages
   - Automatic list refresh after deletion

## ðŸ”’ **Security & Validation**

### Access Control
- **Only ADMIN and SEF roles** can delete trebovanja
- Frontend button is disabled for unauthorized users
- Backend validates user roles before allowing deletion

### Business Rules
- **Cannot delete in_progress trebovanja** - prevents data corruption
- **Cannot delete completed trebovanja** - maintains audit trail
- **Only new and assigned trebovanja** can be deleted

### Data Integrity
- **Cascade deletion** - related records (stavke, zaduznice) are automatically deleted
- **Audit logging** - all deletions are recorded with user and timestamp
- **Transaction safety** - deletion is atomic (all-or-nothing)

## ðŸŽ¯ **User Experience**

### Visual Feedback
- **Confirmation dialog** prevents accidental deletions
- **Loading state** shows deletion in progress
- **Success/error messages** provide clear feedback
- **Disabled state** for non-deletable trebovanja

### Intuitive Interface
- **Red danger button** clearly indicates destructive action
- **Document number** in confirmation for clarity
- **Status-based enabling** - only deletable items show active button

## ðŸ“‹ **Files Modified**

### Backend
- `backend/services/task_service/app/repositories/trebovanje.py` - Added delete method
- `backend/services/task_service/app/routers/trebovanja.py` - Added DELETE endpoint
- `backend/services/task_service/app/models/enums.py` - Added trebovanje_deleted audit action

### Frontend
- `frontend/admin/src/pages/TrebovanjaPage.tsx` - Added delete button and functionality

## ðŸ§ª **Testing**

### Test Cases Covered
1. **Successful deletion** - New/assigned trebovanja can be deleted
2. **Access control** - Only ADMIN/SEF can delete
3. **Business rules** - In-progress/completed trebovanja cannot be deleted
4. **Error handling** - Proper error messages for various scenarios
5. **UI feedback** - Loading states and success/error messages

### Manual Testing
- âœ… Delete button appears in trebovanja list
- âœ… Confirmation dialog shows correct document number
- âœ… Button is disabled for in_progress/done statuses
- âœ… Success message appears after deletion
- âœ… List refreshes automatically after deletion
- âœ… Error messages show for failed deletions

## ðŸš€ **Ready to Use - FULLY TESTED AND WORKING**

The delete functionality is now fully implemented, tested, and ready for use:

### âœ… **Verified Working Features:**
1. **API Gateway Route** - DELETE endpoint properly configured
2. **Database Enum** - `trebovanje.deleted` audit action added
3. **Foreign Key Handling** - Import jobs deleted before trebovanje
4. **Audit Logging** - Deletions properly tracked with user and document info
5. **Role-Based Access** - Only ADMIN and SEF can delete
6. **Business Rules** - Cannot delete in-progress or completed trebovanja

### ðŸŽ¯ **How to Use:**
1. **Navigate to Trebovanja page** in admin interface
2. **Find a trebovanje** with status "new" or "assigned"
3. **Click "ObriÅ¡i"** button in the Actions column
4. **Confirm deletion** in the popup dialog
5. **See success message** and updated list

### âœ… **Tested Successfully:**
- âœ… DELETE API endpoint returns 200 with success message
- âœ… Trebovanje removed from database
- âœ… Related import jobs deleted
- âœ… Audit log entry created with proper details
- âœ… Frontend delete button and confirmation dialog working
- âœ… Error handling for unauthorized access and invalid states

The system will automatically:
- Validate permissions and business rules
- Log the deletion for audit purposes
- Remove all related data safely
- Update the UI with the current state

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Notes**

- **Cascade deletion** is handled by SQLAlchemy relationships
- **Audit logging** uses the existing audit system
- **Role validation** uses the existing authentication system
- **Error handling** follows the existing API patterns
- **UI components** use Ant Design patterns consistently

The implementation follows all existing code patterns and security practices in the system.
